### Tip #1: Impostor syndrome

"I'm not a great engineer..."

```cs
johnnyreilly == good_engineer + 
                works_hard_at_communicating + 
                curious + 
                enthusiastic
```

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>there are more talented engineers in this room than me</li>
<li>you might doubt yourself - but that's just modesty and imposter syndrome</li>
<li>notice it and push through it</li>
</ul>
</aside>

### Tip #2: You belong with me

- What are you interested in?
- What do you use?
- Look at `Contributing.md`
- You're welcome...?

<li>is this a welcoming community</li> 
<li>Invest wisely - if you feel unwelcome then leave</li>
<li>be aware of not first language folk</li>
